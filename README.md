# Glimp2SiDiary #
This is a simple CLI-Tool to convert a Glimp CSV file to the SiDiary CSV format.
Also includes functionality to group the data by month and split the records after n lines, then save it to seperate files.
This exists to circumvent the 30'000 line limitation on SiDiary imports.

### How do I use it? ###
First download the most recent Glimp2SiDiary jar from [here](https://bitbucket.org/certary/glimp2sidiary/downloads/).
Then run the following command to get instructions on using the tool: `java -jar <path-to-the-jar> --help`.
